-try/except: Like the try/catch in Java
             try:
                ...
             except <exception>:
                ...
             else:
                ...
             It's not necessary just to include in the try block the 
               function which raises the exception -> When it's raised in a point of the program,
                                                        the except block is called
             We can use "else" to define code if no exception is raised
             If we define a variable inside the try-block, then 
               it is accessible only in the else block -> We can solve it by using a loop
             Inside the except-block we can insert "pass" -> The only thing it does is interrupting  
                                                               the instruction
