-Tuple: Immutable list of values
        Can be used to return multiple values from a function
        (..., ..., ...) / ..., ..., ... -> Syntax to communicate that the variable is a tuple 
                                           The number of elements can vary
        The elements of a tuple can be referred to through indexing (starting from 0) -> <tuple_name>[0]
-To return mutiple variables you can use a list instead of a tuple -> If you want to change the returning values, you can define 
                                                                        the list containing those values (since it cannot be changed in a tuple)
-In a dictionary, to add an association between a key and a value you can simply put <dict_name>["<key>"]=<value>
-keyword "class": Used to define a class 
                  A constructor can be implemented
                  To initialize an object of a given class -> student = Student()Ã¹
-We can define fields outside the class definition
-Initialization method: def __init__ (self) -> If it takes no arguments
                                     (self, ..., ...) -> If it takes arguments
                        Takes the role of a constructor
-self.<attribute_name> ->  Used to refer to the class' field 
-"raise" keyword: Used to raise an error
-__str__ method: Defined in a class 
                 Called everytime an object of that class is going to be used as a string (for example in a print)
-Each method of a class takes at least one argument called "self"
